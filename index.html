				<h1>A little about me</h1>
				<p id="about"> Hi, thanks for taking the time to visit my page. I'm a new software developer who enjoys building all
					kinds of programs and exploring new technologies. Before starting a career as a developer, I was in
					the Canadian Armed Forces where I worked as a Combat Engineer. Being in the military was a very
					rewarding career. In 2017 I retired from the military after twelve years of service and moved back
					to Ontario with my wife and three children. Ever since retiring I have been pursuing a BSc in
					Computer Science at Western in London Ontario.
